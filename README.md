# ToxicFilter example: Laravel with Laratox

A comment wall moderated with [ToxicFilter](https://toxicfilter.com), built with Laravel with Laratox and Laratox ([edulazaro/laratox](https://github.com/edulazaro/laratox)). Somebody posts a comment and ToxicFilter decides:

- **allow**: it is published at once;
- **review**: it is held, and published or dropped when a person decides in ToxicFilter, which tells the app through a signed webhook;
- **block**: it is refused, and the author is told why in words.

If ToxicFilter cannot be reached, the comment is held rather than published unread. Comments are kept in a JSON file, so there is no database to set up and the moderation is the only code worth reading.

The walkthrough is on the blog: [toxicfilter.com/blog/moderate-comments-in-laravel](https://toxicfilter.com/blog/moderate-comments-in-laravel).

## Run it

```bash
composer install
cp .env.example .env && php artisan key:generate
# set TOXICFILTER_KEY and TOXICFILTER_WEBHOOK_SECRET in .env
php artisan serve --port=8000
php artisan test
```

The moderation is the validation rule in
[`app/Http/Controllers/WallController.php`](app/Http/Controllers/WallController.php); the
webhook is [`ToxicFilterWebhookController`](app/Http/Controllers/ToxicFilterWebhookController.php),
and [`tests/Feature/WallTest.php`](tests/Feature/WallTest.php) covers every path with
`ToxicFilter::fake()`, without calling the API. Requires PHP 8.3 and Laravel 13.

## What you need

- A ToxicFilter key from your [dashboard](https://toxicfilter.com/keys). The free plan is
  enough. A `tf_test_` key is never charged and runs every free check, but never the model:
  use a live key to see what the model says.
- For the review flow, a webhook endpoint pointing at `/webhooks/toxicfilter` and its signing
  secret, from [Webhooks](https://toxicfilter.com/webhooks). On your machine, expose the app
  with a tunnel (`cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8000`, for example) and use that
  address.

Both go in the environment as `TOXICFILTER_KEY` and `TOXICFILTER_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

## The other examples
